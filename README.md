# Pericytes-Project
Contains all the files (except images for copyright reasons) detailed in my paper (reference here). The aim is to be able to measure alterations to the thickness of capilaries in the neighbourhood of pericytes. The results will then be compared for samples of post-stroke and healthy tissues.
